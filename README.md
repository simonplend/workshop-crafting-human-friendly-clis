## Getting ready for the workshop

To get the most from this workshop you'll want to be comfortable writing JavaScript, but it's
fine if you've not used Node.js much before. It'll also help if you have at least a little
experience running commands in a terminal.

### 1. Required software

You'll need to have this software installed:

- Node.js >= v20.18.0 ([how to install](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/))
- npm >= v8
- Your favourite code editor

Check that you have the software versions installed that you need for this workshop
by running these commands in your terminal:

```sh
# Check Node.js version.
node --version

# Check npm version.
npm --version
```

### 2. Clone this repository with Git

You'll need to have this repository cloned so you can work on the coding
exercises during the workshop:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/simonplend/workshop-crafting-human-friendly-clis.git
```

> If you want to commit and push your work to your own repository on GitHub,
> you can [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
> then clone your fork rather than this repository directly.
> If you do create a fork, you'll want to
> [sync it](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
> with this repository at the start of the workshop.

### 3. Open your editor and terminal

There are coding exercises throughout this workshop. To make sure you're ready:

- Open this project in your code editor.
- Open a terminal window for running commands, and `cd` to the directory for
  this project.

You're now ready to get started! ðŸš€

## Workshop exercises

We're going to build a CLI tool with APIs that are available in Node.js core.
This tool will allow us to input notes and store them as daily notes in Markdown
files.

### Create a skeleton CLI

You can generate a skeleton CLI by running the [create-cli](./create-cli)
shell script in your terminal:

```bash
npm run create-cli
```

### Run your CLI

```bash
npx takenote
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Start the first exercise: [01 - Parsing arguments](./exercises/01-parsing-arguments.md)
