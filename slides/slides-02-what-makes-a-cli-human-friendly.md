# Following patterns that already exist

<v-clicks>

- Use POSIX-compliant command line argument syntax
- Standard in/out/err
- Use POSIX signals — SIGINT, TODO
- Exit codes — zero and non-zero
- Piping plain text or JSON between commands

</v-clicks>

<!-- - Follow the conventions of the Unix environment
- There are over 40 years of CLI design conventions that we can draw upon
- Following these conventions provides a strong technical foundation
- Makes a CLI intuitive and guessable
- Makes users efficient -->

# Provide help texts

- Display the more common flags first
- Format and group the help in a way which supports users


---

# Provide lots of examples

- Have a few great examples in documentation
- Don't overwhelm though - have extra cheatsheets if you have loads

# Provide contextual help and guidance

- Suggest command to run next
- Suggest what to do when there’s an error



---

# Output just enough information

...to tell the user what they need to know.

A wall of text is overwhelming.

No information about what's happening can be frustrating.
